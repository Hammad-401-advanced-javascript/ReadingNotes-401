# How to Solve Programming Problems
## Common mistakes
**Improper allocation of time:The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.
You must resist this urge.**

## Steps for solve any algorithm type programming problem:
* Read the problem completely twice.
* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
* Optimize the manual steps.
* Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
* Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
* Optimize the real code.

## Read the problem completely twice
**This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.**

## Optimize the manual solution
**And that by figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.**

## Write pseudo-code or comments
**By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job
of filling in the actual code later trivial.**

## Replace comments with real code
**All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.**

## Optimize the real code
**You should  look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.**

## A few final tips
**The only way you are going to have confidence in this process is to practice it.  It takes a good amount of faith to believe that spending 70% of your 30 minutes to solve
a problem just thinking about the problem and not writing any code**

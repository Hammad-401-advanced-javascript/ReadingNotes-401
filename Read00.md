# How to Solve Programming Problems
## Common mistakes
**Improper allocation of time:The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.
You must resist this urge.**

## Steps for solve any algorithm type programming problem:
* Read the problem completely twice.
* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
* Optimize the manual steps.
* Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
* Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
* Optimize the real code.

## Read the problem completely twice
**This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.**

## Optimize the manual solution
**And that by figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.**

## Write pseudo-code or comments
**By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job
of filling in the actual code later trivial.**

## Replace comments with real code
**All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.**

## Optimize the real code
**You should  look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.**

## A few final tips
**The only way you are going to have confidence in this process is to practice it.  It takes a good amount of faith to believe that spending 70% of your 30 minutes to solve
a problem just thinking about the problem and not writing any code**

# Be More Productive
## How you value your time is how you value your life.

**you should spend your time in activities that help you reach your true goals — your mission**

### Best quotations:

*“Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss*

*“The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”*

*“When you have less time available for work, you have to make better choices about what to work on (and what not to).” -Tim Metz*

*“The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet*

# How to think like a programmer
**Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.**
*“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul*

When you encounter a new problem you should :
## 1. Understand :
**Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them**

## 2. Plan :
**Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.**

## 3. Divide :
 **Break the problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.**
## 4. Stuck?
**This happens to everyone!**
**The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.**

**To deal with this problem correctly, you should :**
* Debug  
* Reassess
* Research

# 5 Why & 5 How

## Introduction to 5 Why & 5 How

**This tool is the 5 Why and 5 How. 5 Why and 5 How was developed in the 1930s by Mr. Sakichi Toyoda.  Mr. Toyoda is the founder of Toyota Industries and is said to be one of the fathers of Japan’s industrial revolution. This technique gained popularity during the 1970s and it is still used by Toyota and may other companies and organizations today.**

## What is 5 Why & 5 How

**The 5 Why method is simply asking the question “Why” enough times until you get past all the symptoms of a problem and down to the root cause. **
*The team will review “Why” did the problem occur and “How” can it be resolved so it does not occur again.*

## How to Perform 5 Why & 5 How

### 1. Form the Team: 
**It should not be done alone at your desk. The team should include representatives familiar with the process in question along with members from Quality, Process Engineering and operators from different shifts or from the next step in the process.**

### 2.Define the Problem:
**The team should also determine the scope of the problem to be addressed.**

## 3.Ask Why:
**Next the team leader or facilitator should ask “Why” the problem or failure mode occurred. The responses must be backed by facts or data and not based on an emotional response.**
**The facilitator should then ask the team if the identified causes were corrected, could the failure mode or problem still occur.**

## 4.Determine and Implement Corrective Actions:
**5 How is a useful method of brainstorming resolutions to the root causes and developing action items to resolve the problem.** 
**Keep asking “How” until you get to the root solution that resolves the root cause.**

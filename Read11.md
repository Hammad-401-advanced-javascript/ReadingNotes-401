# Authentication
 **It is the process of verifying the identity of a person or device.**
 
## User Modeling
**It is a developers responsibility to store that information responsibly.**

## Cryptography
**Is the science which studies methods for encoding messages so that they can be
read only by a person who knows the secret information required for decoding**

**cryptanalysis : the science of decoding encrypted messages without possessing the
proper key, and has several other branches.**

## Hash Algorithms
**A Cryptographic Hash Algorithm takes a piece of data and produces a hash that is deliberately
difficult to reverse.**

## Cypher Algorithms:
**A Cryptographic Cypher Algorithm takes a piece of data and a key and produces encrypted data.
Later the encrypted data can be reversed into the original data by decrypting it using the same key.**

### Basic Authorization:
**Basic Authorization is a common method used to send a username and password in an HTTP request. 
The username and password are joined with a ‘:’ then “base64 encoded” and placed after the string ‘Basic ‘. 
The resulting string is set to the value of an Authorization header.**

**Express lets you run middleware only when certain parameters are present and expected, eliminating that choice.**

**Mongoose takes some of that pain away from us as developers and allows us to provide some level of rules and validation around our data models**

**ORM : programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect,
a virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language**

**Mongoose gives you the ability to take that a step further and use a schema to describe a deeper part of a data model. This can be
useful when a document contains potentially a list of other documents.**

**populate() is a method we can use in Mongoose to connect 2 collection**

**This “join” happens in real time, as the records are being processed by Mongoose and can be quite slow, although convenient.**

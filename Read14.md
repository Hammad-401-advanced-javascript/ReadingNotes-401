# Access Control (ACL)
#### An access control list (ACL) is a table that tells a computer operating system which access rights each user has to 
a particular system object, such as a file directory or individual file. Each object has a security attribute that identifies 
its access control list.

**ACL (Access Control List) Community Auth has an Access Control List (ACL) to help give you finer control over permissions
on your website. This feature is not for direct authentication, and only available after authenticating your user**

**The Three Types of Access Control Systems:**
**Access control systems come in three variations:**

* Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
* Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
* and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

#### What is difference between ACL and firewall?

**The difference between the two lies in how they are implemented. The firewall has just one purpose of examining traffic
and blocking or allowing the traffic. The ACL will have a lot of use cases, unlike a firewall. ... ACL does a stateless inspection,
while Firewall handles a stateful inspection.**

# Bearer Authentication


**Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer
tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic
string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header
when making requests to protected resources**

**Optional bearerFormat is an arbitrary string that specifies how the bearer token is formatted. Since bearer tokens are usually
generated by the server, bearerFormat is used mainly for documentation purposes, as a hint to the clients.**

**You can also define the 401 “Unauthorized” response returned for requests that do not contain a proper bearer token. Since the 
401 response will be used by multiple operations, you can define it in the global components/responses section and reference elsewhere 
via $ref.**

**Rather than continually sending username+password over the internet**
**or undergoing the long OAuth process, we are able to use a
secondary authentication method called “Bearer Token”**

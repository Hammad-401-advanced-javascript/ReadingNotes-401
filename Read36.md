# Getting Started with Redux
**Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.**

**It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that,
it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.**

**You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.**

## Redux principle:
* Have a single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single Redux store.
* The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
* To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.

## Store Methods
* getState()
* dispatch(action)
* subscribe(listener)
* replaceReducer(nextReducer)
* getState()

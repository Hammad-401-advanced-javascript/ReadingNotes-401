# Readings: Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases

## 1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?
**A data model helps design the database at the conceptual, physical and logical levels. Data Model structure helps to define the relational tables, primary and foreign keys and stored procedures. **

## 2.What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
**Within computer programming, the acronym CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. These are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Also, each letter in the acronym can refer to all functions executed in relational database applications and mapped to a standard HTTP method, SQL statement or DDS operation.**
## 3.What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
**PostgreSQL is developed and maintained by the PostgreSQL Development group that is used for the relational database management system.**
**MongoDB Inc that is used for non-relational database management systems**
## 4.What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
**Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.**

### Database:
**A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.**
### Data model:
**data model documents and organizes data, how it is stored and accessed, and the relationships among different types of data.**
### CRUD:
**CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of computer programming and refers to the four functions that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: create, read, update and delete.**
### schema :
**schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated**
### sanitize:
**checking user input before storing it in a database or using it for any other purpose to prevent malicious code injection.**
### SQL:
**SQL statements are used to generate queries from a client program to the database. This can allow the users to execute a wide range of fast data manipulation.**
### noSQL:
**NoSQL provides high scaling out capability. NoSQL allows you to add any kind of data in your database because it is flexible. It also provides distributed storage and high availability of the data. Streaming is also accepted by NoSQL because it can handle a high volume of data which is stored in your database.**
### MongoDB:
**MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.**
### MongoDB V.S SQL :
**The major difference between MongoDB and SQL Databases is the way they handle data. In SQL databases, data is stored in form of traditional 2 dimensional row-column structure while in MongoDB rich data document model is followed, which allows storage of any type of data.**
### Mongoose:
 **Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.**
### record:
**A record is composed of fields and contains all the data about one particular person, company, or item in a database**
### document database:
**A document database is a type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents. Document databases make it easier for developers to store and query data in a database by using the same document-model format they use in their application code.**
### Object Relation Mapping (ORM):
**is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.**

# Linked Lists
## What is a linked list?
**A linked list is an ordered collection of data elements. A data element can be represented as a node in a linked list. Each node consists of two parts: data & pointer to the next node.**
**Unlike arrays, data elements are not stored at contiguous locations. The data elements or nodes are linked using pointers, hence called a linked list.**
## Advantage of a linked list :
**In contrast to an array, which stores data contiguously in memory, a linked list can easily insert or remove nodes from the list without reorganization of the entire data structure.**
## Few drawbacks:
**Random access of data elements is not allowed. Nodes must be accessed sequentially starting from the first one. Therefore, search operation is slow on a linked list.It uses more memory than arrays because of the storage used by their pointers.**
## Types of Linked lists
**There are a few different types of linked lists. But the most popular ones are: singly, doubly and circular.**
## Delete operation on a singly linked list
* Deleting the first node. * Deleting the last node. *Deleting a node from the middle of the list (at a given random position).

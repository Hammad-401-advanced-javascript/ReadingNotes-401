# OAuth

## What is OAuth?

**OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability for “secure designated access.
” For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK for ESPN.com to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having 
to give ESPN your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, your Facebook password
remains safe.**

**OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers.
OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving 
away your password.**


## Why its secure?

**it's the most secure flow because you can authenticate the client to redeem the authorization grant, and tokens are never passed through
a user-agent. There's not just Implicit and Authorization Code flows, there are additional flows you can do with OAuth. Again, OAuth is 
more of a framework**

## JWT  VS OAuth?

**So the real difference is that JWT is just a token format, OAuth 2.0 is a protocol (that may use a JWT as a token format). Firstly, we 
have to differentiate JWT and OAuth. ... OAuth is an authorization protocol that can use JWT as a token. OAuth uses server-side and
client-side storage**
